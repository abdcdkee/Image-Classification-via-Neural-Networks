# Image-Classification-via-Neural-Networks
The algorithm uses neural networks for image classification of the CIFAR-10 dataset.

This algorithm was developed as a part of my Computer Vision course at Habib University in Spring 2020. The attached 'Assignment I' file contains the relevant details of the requisite algorithm features.
